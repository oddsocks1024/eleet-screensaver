V0.3.3: 2012-06-01
    - Fixed: Build time fixes for newer distros which use --as-needed as a
             default GCC option


V0.3.2: 2011-03-14
    - Fixed: Improved building scripts for newer distros
    - Fixed: Now doesn't display cursor. Thanks to "druciferre"


V0.3.1: 2010-06-27
    - Fixed: Minor change to the build scripts to fix compilation on distros
             using the new DSO changes to ld (eg Fedora 13).


V0.3: 2009-10-02
    - Added: Smoothed starfield points for OpenGL/Hardware implementations
             which support it.
    - Added: Thrust particle emission from exhausts.
    - Added: Exhausts do not respond to lighting, giving the effect of glowing
             when not lit.
    - Added: Support for the orbiting ship name on OpenGL implementations that
             do not support 'Non-Power-Of-Two' textures.
    - Added: The orbiting ship name is now randomly coloured.
    - Added: PNG texture support, saving approximately 7.5MB of space.
    - Added: Command line parameters: starnum, thustnum, switch
    - Added: Setup options for XScreensaver
    - Added: [Installer] Also look in /usr/local/kde4/bin and /usr/kde4/bin for
             kde4-config
    - Fixed: The orbiting ship name transparency is now also applied to the
             stars
    - Fixed: Don't show in KDE 'Lost & Found' menu on some distros if both the
             KDE and Gnome versions are installed.
    - Fixed: [Installer] Installing for KDE 4 on BSD should be fixed. Sed on
             BSD does not support the newline character in substitutions.
    - Misc:  Some texture improvements to Remlock
    - Misc:  Reduced clipping distance.
    - Misc:  Starfield optimisations which should improve performance,
             especially on slower systems.


V0.2: 2009-09-06
    - Added: Support for KDE screensaver
    - Added: Support for XScreensaver
    - Added: Window ID can be passed with -window-id <id> parameter
    - Added: Rotating starfield effect shown behind the models
    - Added: Basic lighting
    - Added: Use DisplayLists to 'precompile' OpenGL which should improve
             performance, particularly on low end hardware
    - Fixed: Random ints were only generated up to (upperbound - 2). Worm and
             Zarch models were never shown as a consequence.
    - Fixed: On slow systems, draw events could fill up the queue faster than
             they were processed leading to unresponsive keyboard input or
             termination of Eleet.
    - Fixed: Explicitly free graphics memory for dynamically generated textures
             on exit
    - Misc:  Use gluCheckExtension() instead of parsing
             glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS);
    - Misc:  Major code restructuring
    - Misc:  Primitive optimisations to Asteroid, Cargo and Thargon
    - Misc:  Texture improvement to docking bay doors on Dodec
    - Misc:  Removed random wireframe mode (will likely be an option in future)
    - Misc:  Removed orbiting text for implementations of OpenGL that don't
             have NPOT texture support, in preparation for future work.


V0.1: 2009-08-25
