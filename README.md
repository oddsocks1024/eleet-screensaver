# Eleet Screensaver
## Summary

An OpenGL screensaver for Linux and UNIX, that pays homage to the classic space trading game of Elite.
Eleet displays textured rotating models of various spaceships, based on on those found in Elite. A
random ship is chosen from a pool of 53 models and rotated against a starfield background, whilst
the name of the ship orbits around it. Ships with exhausts will also emit thrust particles.

Eleet supports Gnome Screensaver, KDE Screensaver and XScreensaver and is known to work on Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OpenSolaris
