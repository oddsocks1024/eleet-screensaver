THE ELEET SCREENSAVER

1. WHAT IS IT?
A screensaver for use with Linux and UNIX, that pays homage to the classic
space trading game of Elite. Eleet displays textured rotating OpenGL models
of various spaceships, based on on those found in Elite.

A random ship is chosen from a pool of 53 models and rotated against a
starfield background, whilst the name of the ship orbits around it. Ships with
exhausts will also emit thrust particles.


2. HOW TO USE ELEET
If Eleet compiles and installs successfully for you, then it should be
available from the gnome-screensaver-preferences program or available in the
KDE screensaver preferences. Xscreensaver is supported, but requires manual
installation. ELEET does not support Gnome3.

Eleet can also run standalone which may be useful for testing.

SYNOPSIS
eleet [-window-id <wid>] [-starnum <snum>] [-thrustnum <tnum>] [-switch <secs>]

    <wid>: The X window identifier in which to render. If no window identifier
           is specified, Eleet will create its own window.
   <snum>: An integer specifying the number of stars to draw. The value must be
           between 10 and 1000 inclusive. Default = 250.
   <tnum>: An integer specifying the number of thrust particles to draw. The
           value must be between 100 and 1000 inclusive. Default = 500
   <secs>: An integer specifying the time in seconds to wait before switching
           to another model. Must be between 30 and 600 inclusive. Default = 60


3. FAQ

    * Which screensaver systems are supported?
    - Officially Gnome 2, KDE 4 and XScreensaver. Others might work but have
      not been tested. Gnome 3 does not support screensavers

    * I can't access the configuration or setup options, why?
    - You should be able to configure the screensaver if you're using
      XScreensaver.
    - Configuring the screensaver under KDE is only supported, if the
      XScreensaver configuration files are installed.
    - The Gnome screensaver system, does not support screensaver configuration.

    * I'm running KDE or Gnome and Eleet compiled and installed, but I can't
      find it in the screensaver list. Any ideas?
    - Some distributions replace Gnome's or KDE's native screensaver system
      with Xscreensaver. Try following the install instructions for
      Xscreensaver.
    - You may need to specify the correct install prefix with configure. Eleet
      is installed in the "/usr/local" prefix by default unless specified
      otherwise.

    * Why does support for Xscreensaver need to be installed manually?
    - Xscreensaver does not appear to provide a mechanism to detect where its
      screensavers and configuration files should be installed and I haven't
      found a method which works safely and reliably across all supported
      operating systems.

    * Is KDE 3 supported?
    - Not officially, as Eleet's build system is not configured for it. However
      with some manual intervention you can probably get it working.

    * Eleet runs really slowly, why?
    - Eleet makes use of OpenGL. The most likely cause is that you don't
      have hardware accelerated 3D and therefore most of the work is being
      handled by the CPU instead of the GPU. Usually this is a misconfigured
      system, or your graphics chipset is too old.

    * Where do I send bug reports?
    - See the AUTHORS file.
